# Roguelike

We were asked to make a roguelike game made with the C language in a two devs team.

We had two months to build a consistent modularized architecture adapted to the specificities of C.

The purpose was to translate an algorithm into C instructions to create a randomized maze for each floor of the dungeon, the user can move the character in the maze to find the scales which allows him to reach the following floor.
The character can meet monsters and treasure chests. Monsters can be defeated by using abilities, potions, weapons, spells... which are provided by the chests.

















## Requirements

This works by using the **MLV lib** (made by the Gustave Eiffel university) for the graphical part of the project. This library is based on the SDL.

 - [Install MLV lib](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~boussica/mlv/index.html)


## Usage

All the information about the usage of this project is gathered in a user file.

## Demo

## Optimizations

In the future, we plan to improve the graphical and sound elements to make it more enjoyable.
